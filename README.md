# honeypot-project-cowrie
This project involves setting up a Cowrie honeypot to simulate an SSH and Telnet service, allowing for the capture and analysis of unauthorized access attempts. The goal is to understand common attack patterns and behaviors by collecting and analyzing attack data. This honeypot will be deployed in a VirtualBox environment to isolate it from the host system.

Project Goals:
  Deploy a Cowrie honeypot in a virtualized environment (VirtualBox).
  Simulate SSH and Telnet services to attract attackers.
  Collect and log attack data for analysis.
  Analyze attack patterns, common commands used by attackers, and IP addresses involved.
  Present findings and discuss potential improvements for honeypot configurations.

Project Structure:
docs/: Contains documentation for each setup step and configuration details.
scripts/: Includes any custom scripts for data parsing or analysis.
data/: Stores captured logs and sample data (anonymized).
analysis/: Holds findings, visualizations, and reports.
Environment Setup
VirtualBox Installation: Set up VirtualBox and create a virtual machine for the honeypot.
Operating System: Install Ubuntu 20.04 as the base OS for the VM.
Cowrie Installation: Clone the Cowrie repository, set up a virtual environment, and configure Cowrie for SSH and Telnet emulation.
Network Configuration: Configure network settings and port forwarding to allow access to Cowrie from outside the VM.
Steps to Run the Honeypot
Launch VirtualBox and start the VM with the configured honeypot.
Run Cowrie within the VM to begin capturing logs.
Monitor logs in real-time to observe unauthorized access attempts.
Data Collection and Analysis
Over a period of time, data will be collected and analyzed. Key data points include:

IP addresses of attackers.
Commands and actions attempted.
Frequency and timing of attacks.
Geolocation analysis of attacking IP addresses.
Sample Commands for Data Analysis
bash
Copy code
# Example command to count unique IPs
cat cowrie.log | grep "login attempt" | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Example command to list common commands attempted by attackers
cat cowrie.log | grep "CMD" | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
Findings
Summarize findings here as you progress, such as common IPs, frequent commands used, and any patterns observed.

Future Enhancements
Additional Services: Consider simulating other services to gather broader attack data.
Improved Analysis: Implement data parsing scripts to automate analysis.
Deployment on Cloud: Explore deploying the honeypot on a cloud platform for increased exposure.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the setup and data analysis capabilities of a honeypot, highlighting key cybersecurity skills in environment configuration, data collection, and pattern analysis.
